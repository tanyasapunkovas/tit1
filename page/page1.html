    <h1>British cat Emilio.</h1>
    <h2>Let's get to know each other.</h2>
    <p>I am a British cat. My name is Emilio. I am 5 years old. My weight is 8 kg, I am not fat, this is my weight for the breed. I have been living in a private house for three years, I am lucky that the terrier has somewhere to walk, I even have my own yard, sometimes I look out the gate to the street, I would walk along the street, but they don't let me in.</p>

    <h2>The competitor is a cat Murka.</h2>
    <p>The competitor is a cat Murka.I also have a competitor, she came without a shelter and decided to live in the yard, they kindly let her into the summer kitchen and there she has lived for 2.5 years and teaches me to infect and sleep in the garden, eat flowers.</p>

    <h2>My devices.</h2>
    <p>My devices.I also have an automatic feeder, but in winter I would eat more. And if they forget to give me water, first I meow and scratch the drinking bowl, and then I turn it over.</p>

    <p>Fairy tales for new owners.
    They also said about me that I am a cat for businessmen, who sleeps on the bedside table, who only lies for beauty and does not get sick, but everything did not go according to plan.
    I am a cat who loves to be near his owner, feed him and sleep next to him, but you can't pick me up and carry me, I sleep where I want and as much as I want.
    I am a temperamental cat, I love to run and play.
    I got a little sick with panleukopenia, urolithiasis, I scratched my throat with a pine needle, recently I have an eye injury. But in general I am a problem-free cat.</p>
